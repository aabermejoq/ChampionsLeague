Football clubs invest heavily in player transfers to strengthen their teams, making it essential to understand how these investments relate to team performance.

This report compiles two key data sources for future analysis. First, I gather player transaction data from transfermarkt.com for the 36 clubs in the UEFA Champions League since 1997, providing details on transfer spending and financial strategies. Second, I collect team performance data from clubelo.com, which uses ELO ratings to measure team strength based on match results.

By presenting these datasets, this report sets the foundation for understanding the connection between financial investments on players and team performance in elite European football.
